I believe that Billy Jones who was the dealer during the losses on dated 03/10, 03/12 and 03/15 and player Mylie Schmidt were in cahoots with scamming Lucky Duck.  I believe this to be true because on each day Mylie played and the casino lost money, Billy was the dealer at the roulette table.  The times for these incidents also match.
